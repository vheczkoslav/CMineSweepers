There is one mandatory and one voluntary CLI argument: first mandatory is a map size/difficulty and it ranges from 1 to 3
'1' is 9 x 9 tiles
'2' is 16 x 16 tiles
'3' is 30 x 30 tiles
Voluntary parameter is '-d' or '--debug' which gives you an additional debug window on which you can see location of all bombs
